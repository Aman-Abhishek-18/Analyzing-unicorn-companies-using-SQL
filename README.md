In the Analyzing Unicorn Companies project, we look to figure out how many companies reached a valuation of over 1 billion dollars across different industries in a given time period.

Specifically, we need to identify the three best-performing industries based on the number of new high-growth companies created in that period, find the number of unicorns that emerged within these industries by year, the year when each of those companies became a unicorn, and their average valuation in billions of dollars. And all this information you can obtain in just one query!


Here, we will be having 3 tables, Companies, Valuations, and FundingRounds

Table: Companies
